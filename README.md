# RU-Kindergarten

The purpose of this project was to implement a simulation of a kindergarten classroom using Java and fundamental data structures. The simulation involves three key classroom activities: students standing in line, students seated at their desks, and students playing a game of musical chairs. Each activity is modeled using a different data structure, reinforcing understanding of singly linked lists, 2D arrays, and circular linked lists.

The following objectives were implemented and demonstrated through this simulation:

 - Simulate a line of students using a Singly Linked List
 - Create a classroom seating chart using a 2D boolean array and seat students using a 2D Student array
 - Move students into a Circular Linked List to simulate a musical chairs game
 - Randomly eliminate students during the game and insert them back into the line alphabetically
 - Determine a winner from the game and seat them in the classroom

Java was the primary language used, with custom classes for student data and node structures. File I/O was managed using StdIn and StdOut, and randomness for the game was provided via the StdRandom utility.

Within the contents of this repository, youâ€™ll find the core implementation (Classroom.java), supporting classes (Student.java, SNode.java), a driver for testing (Driver.java), and example input files containing student and seating data.

Key concepts reinforced:

 - Linked List insertion/removal
 - Circular linked list traversal
 - 2D array indexing and management
 - File parsing and simulation control
